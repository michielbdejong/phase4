# Configuration

The primary configuration file for phase4 is called `phase4.properties`.
It contains both the phase4 specific configuration items as well as the WSS4J ones (see https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/config.html).
The resolution of the configuration properties is not bound to the configuration file - system properties and environment variables can also be used. See https://github.com/phax/ph-commons#ph-config for details.
Upon resolution of configuration values, Java system properties have the highest priority (400), before environment variables (300), the file `phase4.properties` (203), the file `private-application.json` (195), the file `private-application.properties` (190), the file `application.json` (185), the file `application.properties` (180) and finally the file `reference.properties` (1).

Note: programmatic access to the configuration is solely achieved via class `com.helger.phase4.config.AS4Configuration`.

## WSS4J properties

Note: the descriptions and the default values are taken from [WSS4J](https://ws.apache.org/wss4j/config.html).

* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.provider`**: WSS4J specific provider used to create Crypto instances. Defaults to `org.apache.wss4j.common.crypto.Merlin`.
* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.keystore.type`**: the keystore type. Usually one of `JKS` or `PKCS12`. Defaults to `java.security.KeyStore.getDefaultType()`.
* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.keystore.file`**: the path to the keystore. Can be an entry in the class path, a URL or an absolute file path.
* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.keystore.password`**: the password to the whole keystore.
* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.keystore.alias`**: the alias of the key to be used inside the keystore. **Hint** case sensitivity may be important here.
* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.keystore.private.password`**: the password to access the key only. May be different from the keystore password.

* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.load.cacerts`**: Whether or not to load the CA certificates in `${java.home}/lib/security/cacerts` (default is `false`).
* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.truststore.provider`**: The provider used to load truststores. By default it’s the same as the keystore provider. Set to an empty value to force use of the JRE’s default provider.
* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.truststore.type`**: The truststore type. Usually one of `JKS` or `PKCS12`. Defaults to `java.security.KeyStore.getDefaultType()`.
* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.truststore.file`**: The location of the truststore. Can be an entry in the class path, a URL or an absolute file path.
* **`org.apache.wss4j.crypto.merlin.truststore.password`**: The truststore password. Defaults to `changeit`.

Note: for Peppol users the key store must contain the AccessPoint private key and the truststore must contain the Peppol truststore.

## phase4 properties

The properties have the following meaning
* **`global.debug`**: enable or disable the global debugging mode in the system. It is recommended to have this always set to `false` except you are developing with the components. Valid values are `true` and `false`.
* **`global.production`**: enable or disable the global production mode in the system. It is recommended to have this set to `true` when running an instance in a production like environment to improve performance and limit internal checks. Valid values are `true` and `false`.
* **`global.nostartupinfo`**: disable the logging of certain internals upon server startup when set to `true`. Valid values are `true` and `false`.
* **`global.datapath`**: the writable directory where the server stores data. It is recommended to be an absolute path (starting with `/`). The default value is the relative directory `conf`.

* **`phase4.manager.inmemory`**: if this property is set to `true` than phase4 will not create persistent data for PModes ands other domain objects. The default value is `true`.
* **`phase4.wss4j.syncsecurity`**: if this property is set to `true` all signing, encryption, signature verification and decryption is linearized in an artificial lock. This should help working around the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WSS-660 bug if one Java runtime needs to contain multiple instances of phase4. Note: this flag is still experimental. Note: this is only a work-around if only phase4 based applications run in the same Java runtime - if other WSS4J applications (like e.g. Oxalis) are also run, this switch does not solve the issue. Defaults to `false`.
* **`phase4.profile`**: a specific AS4 profile ID that can be used to validate incoming messages. Only needed in specific circumstances. Not present by default.
* **`phase4.incoming.duplicatedisposal.minutes`**: the number of minutes a message is kept for duplication check. After that time, the same message can be retrieved again. Valid values are integer numbers &ge; 0. The default value is `10`.
* **`phase4.dump.path`**: the base path where dumps of incoming and outgoing files should be created, if the respective dumpers are activated. The default value is `phase4-dumps` relative to the current working directory.
* **`phase4.endpoint.address`**: the public URL of this AS4 server to send responses to. This value is optional.

# Profiles vs. PModes

To handle common parts of AS4 PModes this project uses so called "profiles". Currently the following profiles are provided out of the box:

* CEF with ID `cef` in submodule `phase4-profile-cef` - see https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eDelivery+AS4+-+1.14 for the full specification
* Peppol with ID `peppol` in submodule `phase4-profile-peppol` - see https://docs.peppol.eu/edelivery/as4/specification/ for the full specification
* ENTSOG with ID `entsog` in submodule `phase4-profile-entsog` - see https://www.entsog.eu/interoperability-and-data-exchange-nc for the full specification

To use one of these profiles, the respective Maven artifacts must be added as dependencies to your project as in

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.helger</groupId>
      <artifactId>phase4-profile-cef</artifactId>
      <version>x.y.z</version>
    </dependency>
```

or

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.helger</groupId>
      <artifactId>phase4-profile-peppol</artifactId>
      <version>x.y.z</version>
    </dependency>
```

or

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.helger</groupId>
      <artifactId>phase4-profile-entsog</artifactId>
      <version>x.y.z</version>
    </dependency>
```

If you want to create your own profile, you need to provide an [SPI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html) implementation of the `phase4-lib` interface `com.helger.phase4.profile.IAS4ProfileRegistrarSPI`. See the above mentioned submodules as examples on how to do that.


# Peppol handling

Peppol is an international eDelivery network. Read more on https://peppol.eu

## Peppol Prerequisites

To perform testing with Peppol you **MUST** have a valid Peppol certificate.
Testing with a self-signed certificate does **not** work.
Only certificates that are based on the Peppol AP PKI will be accepted.
You may read https://peppol.helger.com/public/locale-en_US/menuitem-docs-peppol-pki for more information on the Peppol PKI.
To retrieve a Peppol certificate, you must be a member of OpenPEPPOL AISBL - see https://peppol.eu/get-involved/join-openpeppol/ for details.

## Peppol AS4 specifics

OASIS AS4 is a profile of OASIS EBMS v3. CEF AS4 is a profile of OASIS AS4. Peppol AS4 is a profile of CEF AS4. Find the Peppol specification document at https://docs.peppol.eu/edelivery/as4/specification/

Peppol has a very limited use of AS4. Some highlights are:
* It uses only one-way push
* TLS certificates must have SSL labs test grade "A" - that means e.g. no TLS 1.0 or 1.1 support
* Signing and encryption rules follow the CEF AS4 profile requirements (AES 128 CGM, SHA-256)
* It allows only for one payload
* You have to use MIME encoding for the payload - and are not allowed to add it into the SOAP body
* The payload is always an SBD envelope (Standard Business Document; mostly wrongly addressed as SBDH - Standard Business Document Header) - same as for Peppol AS2
* Compression must be supported but can be chosen on the senders discretion

## Subproject phase4-peppol-client

This subproject is your entry point for **sending** messages into the Peppol eDelivery network.

The contained project contains a class called `Phase4PeppolSender.Builder` (accessible via factory method `Phase4PeppolSender.builder()`) - it contains all the parameters with some example values so that you can start easily. Alternatively the class `Phase4PeppolSender.SBDHBuilder` (accessible via factory method `Phase4PeppolSender.sbdhBuilder()`) offers a build class where you can add your pre-build StandardBusinessDocument, which implies that no implicit validation of the business document takes place. This class contains utility methods to explicitly validate the payload.

As a prerequisite, the file `phase4.properties` must be filled out correctly and your Peppol AP certificate must be provided (the default configured name is `test-ap.p12`).

See the folder https://github.com/phax/phase4/tree/master/phase4-peppol-client/src/test/java/com/helger/phase4/peppol for different examples on how to send messages via the Peppol AS4 client.

The client side validation of outgoing business documents is implemented using [PHIVE](https://github.com/phax/phive) (Philip Helger Integrative Validation Engine).

## Subproject phase4-peppol-servlet

This subproject is your entry point for **receiving** messages from the Peppol eDelivery network using the well known Servlet technology.

It assumes you are running an Application server like [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) or [Eclipse Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) to handle incoming connections. Integrations into other application servers like vertx or even the deployment as an AWS Lambda is possible but needs a bit more handcrafting.

Register the Servlet `com.helger.phase4.peppol.servlet.Phase4PeppolServlet` in your application.
Then implement the SPI interface `com.helger.phase4.peppol.servlet.IPhase4PeppolIncomingSBDHandlerSPI` to handle incoming Peppol messages. See [Introduction to the Service Providers Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html) if you are not familiar with the Java concept of SPI.

Sample setup for `WEB-INF/web.xml`:

```xml
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>Phase4PeppolServlet</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>com.helger.phase4.peppol.servlet.Phase4PeppolServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>Phase4PeppolServlet</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>/as4</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

By default the "receiver checks" are enabled. They are checking if an incoming message is targeted for the correct Access Point and if not will reject the message. That is done by performing an SMP lookup on the receiver/document type/process ID and check if the resulting values match the preconfigured values. That of course requires that the preconfigured values need to be set, before a message can be received. That needs to be done via the static methods in class `Phase4PeppolServletConfiguration`. Alternatively you can disable the receiver checks using the `setReceiverCheckEnabled` method in said class.

Additionally before you can start, an `IAS4CryptoFactory` MUST be set. An implementation of this interface provides the keystore as well as the private key for doing signing and/or encryption services in phase4. Default implementations shipping with phase4 are `AS4CryptoFactoryProperties` and `AS4CryptoFactoryInMemoryKeyStore`. To change that configuration use the extended constructor of `AS4XServletHandler` that itself is instantiated in the `Phase4PeppolServlet` - therefore a custom Servlet class is required, where `Phase4PeppolServlet` should be used as the "copy-paste template" (and don't forget to reference the new servlet class from the `WEB-INF/web.xml` mentioned above). 

## Subproject phase4-peppol-server-webapp

This subproject shows how to a simple standalone Peppol AS4 server could look like.
It is a **demo** implementation and does not do anything with the payload except storing it on disk.
Use this as the basis for implementing your own solution - don't take it "as is".
It takes incoming requests via HTTP POST at the URL `/as4`.

Upon startup it checks that a valid Peppol Access Point (AP) certificate is installed.

It stores all incoming requests on disk based on the incoming date time.
* The full incoming message is stored with extension `.as4in`
* The SOAP document is stored with extension `.soap`
* The (decrypted) Peppol payload (SBD Document) is stored with extension `.sbd`
* The returned receipt is stored with extension `.response`

To configure your certificate, modify the file `phase4.properties`. Usually there is no need to alter the truststore - it's the Peppol default truststore and considered to be constant.

Note: this application uses the property `smp.url` in configuration file `phase4.properties` to locate it's home SMP for cross checking if the incoming request is targeted for itself.

To start it from within your IDE you may run the test class `com.helger.phase4.peppol.server.standalone.RunInJettyPHASE4PEPPOL` - it will spawn on http://localhost:8080`.
For IntelliJ users: make sure the folder `phase4-peppol-server-webapp` is the startup directory.

# Usage with Maven

If you want to use phase4 with Maven I suggest the following way:

1. add the BOM into your `<dependencyManagement>` section and
2. add the main artefacts without version in the `<dependency>` block to have a consistent versioning:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
...
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
...
      <!-- step 1 -->
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.helger.phase4</groupId>
        <artifactId>phase4-parent-pom</artifactId>
        <version>x.y.z</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
      </dependency>
...
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
...
  <dependencies>
...
    <!-- step 2 -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.helger.phase4</groupId>
      <artifactId>phase4-lib</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.helger.phase4</groupId>
      <artifactId>phase4-profile-peppol</artifactId>
    </dependency>
...
  </dependencies>
...
</project>
```

# Building from source

Apache Maven needed 3.6 or later and Java JDK 8 or later is required.

To build the whole package on the commandline use `mvn clean install -U`.

If you are importing this into your IDE and you get build errors, it maybe necessary to run `mvn process-sources` once in the `phase4-lib` subproject. Afterwards the folder `target/generated-sources/xjc` must be added to the source build path. When building only on the commandline, this is done automatically.

# Running with Docker

```sh
docker build -t phase4 .
docker run --network=host -d phase4
curl http://localhost:8080/[?]
```

# Known limitations

Per now the following known limitations exist:
* phase4 is not a standalone project but a library that you need to manually integrate into your system 
* Multi-hop is not implemented
* Split and join is not implemented

# How to help

Any voluntary help on this project is welcome.
If you want to write documentation or test the solution - I'm glad for every help.
Just write me an email - see pom.xml for my email address

If you like the project, a star on GitHub is always appreciated.
